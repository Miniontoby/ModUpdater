Command Line Usage
---------------

If you don't have an interface on your computer, you will still be able to use this ModUpdater!

Here are the possible commands with their params:
- `checkMod <pid> <version>`
- `installMod <pid> <version> <.minecraft folder>`
- `updateAllMods <.minecraft folder>`
- `installModpack <.minecraft folder>`
- `version`
- `help`

These commands work the same as with the GUI one, but the GUI just makes it simpler to use this ModUpdater
